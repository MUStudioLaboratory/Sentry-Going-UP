Sentry-Going-UP
===============

Sentry-Going-UP is the robot by using Arduino Leonardo and ARM Linux(Raspberry pi or ODROID).
Arduino code will be written in Arduino IDE,Of course.
Motion tracking will be based on OpenCV and C/C++.
It has to be cross-compiled.
(Also it can be ported to Processing or QT or Python,maybe)
It's just for killing time, so it's progress will be very slow.
